## Welcome to my Github Page! ðŸ‘‹
- I am currently a student, learning to program in C# and trying to work with monogame.
- I am a freelance composer, please hit me up on discord! - @wong_gaming
- I'm looking to collaborate on FL Studio, to try and broaden my view on composition.
- I'm looking for help with machine learning and deep learning, as my project that I am doing for school requires this.

## Thank you for reading this! Have a wonderful day! âœ¨âœ¨
